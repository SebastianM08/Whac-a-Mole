# Whack-a-Mole 

Whack a mole is a very simple game where you have nine tiles and in each tile there is a hole where the mole can appear and the goal is to whack them all by clicking on it. 
I decided to make the game a bit more fun by making it a Pokemon themed game.
For each hole we have a pokeball, as the mole we have pikachu and also we have diglett 
The goal is to click on Pikachu every time he appears from the pokeball and avoid clicking on Diglett or you'll be out of luck.
